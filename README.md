# HKUST USToken Club System User Guide

The **HKUST USToken Club System** is a blockchain-based platform for managing club participation at HKUST. Using **USTokens**, it rewards attendance and encourages engagement. As an **organizer**, you create and manage clubs; as a **member**, you join and participate in clubs. When you first join or create a club, you receive **10 USTokens**, which are automatically staked.

This guide outlines the high-level functions for **organizers** and **members** to help you get started.
